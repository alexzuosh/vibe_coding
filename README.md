# Vibe Coding Project

Author: Alex Zuo

This is a vibe coding project powered by AI. We are exploring the intersection of creativity and artificial intelligence to build software that feels right. 
Welcome to the future of coding, where vibes meet algorithms.

## What is Vibe Coding?

**Vibe Coding** is a development philosophy that emphasizes:
- **Intuitive Design**: Code that naturally expresses intent
- **AI Collaboration**: Leveraging AI to enhance developer productivity
- **Flow State**: Writing code that feels effortless and enjoyable
- **Clear Intent**: Every line of code should communicate its purpose clearly

## Project Overview

LiteGPU is a lightweight Linux kernel driver for a hypothetical GPU device. This project demonstrates vibe coding principles through:
- Clean, well-documented code that's easy to understand
- Modular architecture that's easy to extend
- AI-assisted development workflow
- Focus on developer experience

## Getting Started

### Building the Driver

```bash
make
```

### Loading the Module

```bash
sudo insmod lite_gpu.ko
```

### Testing

```bash
gcc test_gpu.c -o test_gpu
./test_gpu
```

## Contributing

This project welcomes contributions! Feel free to explore the open issues and contribute in the spirit of vibe coding.
